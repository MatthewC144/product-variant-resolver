## 2026-09-01 — Lite/MVP fixture implementation and handoff

### Context, problem, and observable outcome

This iteration ran in **Lite / MVP Mode**. The starting specification described a production-shaped
resolver—catalog-backed identity, hybrid retrieval, reranking, calibrated abstention, an API, and a
reproducible benchmark—but the useful first delivery had to be demonstrable without claiming that
PostgreSQL, pgvector, external models, or a real marketplace catalog already worked. The engineering
problem was therefore twofold: build a complete resolution loop that could run offline, and make
every resulting claim traceable to a frozen fixture and an explicit runtime boundary.

The delivered offline path now accepts a noisy title, extracts generic syntax and catalog-derived
hints, retrieves candidates through sparse, dense, and structured signals, fuses them with RRF,
calibrates the leading candidate, and returns `matched`, `ambiguous`, or `no_match`. FastAPI exposes
that path through `/resolve` and `/health`; the default response omits internal evidence, while
`debug=true` returns bounded signals, ranks, conflicts, model versions, and stage timings. The
observable result is a versioned `fixture-v1` report over 21 synthetic test cases rather than an
unsupported production claim: Recall@25 and Top-1 are `1.0`, hard-negative accuracy is `1.0` (4/4),
precision is `1.0`, false-match rate is `0.0`, and coverage is `0.8333`.

Focused re-verification exposed three places where the implementation and its claims needed to be
tightened. First, series text needed to be treated as catalog knowledge, not an application-coded
rule, and a wrong series needed to remain a visible soft conflict rather than filter out the correct
candidate. Second, the heuristic reranker had been available in the pipeline without evidence that
it improved the fused ranking. Third, latency needed an HTTP-level measurement and an explicit
statement of what that measurement excluded. After correction, catalog-provided series values
produce `series_hints`; a target with a conflicting series remains in the top 25 and records
`structured_conflicts=["series"]`; RRF and the heuristic reranker both score Top-1 `1.0` on the same
12 matched frozen-test cases; and the report retains warmed in-process ASGI samples while stating
that Docker, TCP, reverse proxy, database, and concurrency were not measured.

### Implementation trace

The implementation was organized by pipeline responsibility so that each claim has a narrow code
and test surface:

- `data/`, `scripts/generate_fixture_data.py`, and `scripts/validate_fixture_data.py` establish the
  frozen catalog, benchmark, grouped split metadata, checksums, provenance, and fixture validators.
  This was necessary to make evaluation reproducible and to prevent synthetic data from being
  presented as scraped marketplace truth.
- `src/product_variant_resolver/{identity,catalog,ingestion}.py` defines immutable UUID/slug
  behavior, normalized catalog records, and idempotent in-memory ingestion.
  `src/product_variant_resolver/{signals,schemas}.py` keeps syntax
  extraction typed and generic. The series correction was implemented through the catalog-derived
  vocabulary assembled in `src/product_variant_resolver/service.py`, passed into
  `extract_signals`, and represented as
  `series_hints`; no Hot Wheels series branch was added to application code.
- `src/product_variant_resolver/retrieval.py` contains the token sparse baseline, deterministic
  `hashing-v1` dense baseline,
  structured match/conflict features, RRF, and fail-closed retrieval orchestration. Series joins
  year, color, collector number, and series position as a soft structured feature so conflicting
  evidence remains inspectable instead of destructively pruning a candidate.
- `src/product_variant_resolver/{rerank,service,config}.py` provides the pointwise interface, optional
  `heuristic-v1` implementation, pipeline assembly, and runtime selection. `reranker_enabled`
  defaults to false; when disabled, debug and health metadata report `disabled` instead of implying
  that a reranker ran.
- `src/product_variant_resolver/{calibration,policy,training}.py` implements logistic calibration,
  train-only model
  fitting, dev-only threshold selection, artifact/version checks, and the three-state decision
  policy. Training and evaluation both use the same catalog-derived color and series vocabulary,
  avoiding a mismatch between runtime and offline scoring.
- `src/product_variant_resolver/{api,observability}.py` and `ui/` supply structured request
  validation, error mapping,
  readiness, request correlation, privacy-safe logging, stage timings, and the minimal debug UI.
  API-provided strings are rendered as text, and raw titles are not placed in resolution logs.
- `src/product_variant_resolver/{evaluation,reporting}.py`,
  `scripts/generate_evaluation_report.py`, and `reports/fixture-v1/` preserve raw ranks, decision
  counts, latency samples, derivations, configuration, disclaimers, and SVG summaries. Reporting
  now records `selected_default="rrf"`, the exact reranker gain,
  whether an external cross-encoder was evaluated, and whether container latency was measured.
- `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/api/`, `tests/evaluation/`, and `tests/ui/` cover identity,
  parsing, soft conflicts, fusion, calibration/policy guards, three-state resolution, fail-closed
  behavior, report disclosures, and UI rendering. `migrations/`, `Dockerfile`, and
  `docker-compose.yml` preserve future persistence/deployment boundaries, but their presence is not
  counted as runtime verification.

### Technical choices, alternatives, and trade-offs

The default retrieval path uses deterministic token overlap plus `hashing-v1` vectors because both
run offline and make the fixture loop reproducible. The specification's PostgreSQL FTS and exact
pgvector path remains the intended scalable alternative, while a pinned sentence-transformer is the
intended semantic alternative. The trade-off is deliberate: the current baselines have low setup
cost and fail no external dependency, but `hashing-v1` is not a neural embedding and the measured
fixture accuracy cannot establish semantic recall on real marketplace titles.

RRF was chosen over direct addition of sparse and dense scores because the component scores live on
different scales, while RRF needs only ranks and remains deterministic. Weighted score fusion could
eventually learn more domain-specific signal weighting, but it would add tuning risk to a 100-case
synthetic benchmark. Structured attributes therefore contribute explicit matches and conflicts
without becoming hard filters, preserving recall when seller titles contain an incorrect year,
color, or series.

Calibration and abstention were retained instead of an always-pick-Top-1 policy because an entity
resolver must refuse weak or near-tied evidence. The calibration model is fit on grouped train data,
thresholds are selected on grouped dev data, and test labels are held for final evaluation. This
adds artifact and policy-version management, but it makes `ambiguous` and `no_match` first-class
outcomes and exposes the precision/coverage trade-off.

The pointwise reranker underwent an explicit **selection reversal**. Before the frozen comparison,
the architecture allowed the local heuristic after RRF as a normal pipeline stage. Catalog-derived
series handling then strengthened the generic retrieval and structured evidence, and the same 12
matched test queries produced Top-1 `1.0` for both RRF and `heuristic-v1`. The measured absolute gain
was therefore `0.0`, below the R11 `0.05` value gate. After that evidence, the runtime default was
changed to RRF, the heuristic became an opt-in/offline ablation via
`PVR_RERANKER_ENABLED=true`, and calibration/policy versions were aligned with the RRF path. This
avoids paying for and explaining an unproven stage while preserving a replaceable pointwise
interface. No external cross-encoder was evaluated, so this decision does not predict whether a
pinned neural reranker would help on real hard negatives.

### Verification evidence

Final QA recorded **PASS WITH RISKS** for the dependency-light fixture path. The available unit,
integration, API, UI harness, fixture, training, evaluation, and reporting suite passed 38/38;
Python compilation and fixture validation passed; calibration and dev-selected policy artifacts
were regenerated with `test_labels_accessed=false`; and both default and PostgreSQL-profile Compose
configurations passed static validation. Manual API checks observed all three decision states,
default debug omission, bounded debug candidates, structured validation failures, and fail-closed
responses for a missing catalog, PostgreSQL backend selection, unavailable external providers, and
a simulated retriever failure.

The frozen data evidence is `fixture-v1`: 120 products and 100 benchmark cases (`60 matched`,
`20 ambiguous`, `20 no_match`) across 14 casting families and 30 near-duplicate groups. Families
occur in exactly one query split, and the catalog and benchmark SHA-256 values match
`data/manifest.json`. The checked-in report evaluates exactly 21 synthetic test cases, including 12
matched cases, and retains the raw counts used by every headline metric.

Latency evidence is intentionally bounded. The latest checked-in report records internal-pipeline
p95 `1.5525 ms` and warmed in-process HTTP/ASGI p95 `7.9523 ms`, each over 21 sequential samples
after five excluded warm-up requests at candidate K=25. A separate fresh QA regeneration recorded
HTTP/ASGI p95 `2.45 ms`; both remain below the 1500 ms fixture smoke budget. These numbers include
FastAPI middleware, validation, dispatch, serialization, and response headers only for the
in-process boundary. They do not include Docker/container startup or execution, TCP/network,
PostgreSQL, a reverse proxy, concurrency, or load, and must not be reported as production latency.

Traceable sources are the [MVP brief](../specs/product-variant-resolver/mvp-brief.md),
[final QA review](../specs/product-variant-resolver/review.md),
[versioned report](../reports/fixture-v1/evaluation-fixture-v1-test.md), and
[MVP evidence](evidence/product-variant-resolver-mvp.md).

### Incomplete work, risks, and next step

The offline fixture path is demonstrable, but the original technology scope is not complete.
`PostgresRetrieverAdapter.execute_ranked` remains unimplemented; Alembic migration cycles,
PostgreSQL ingestion, FTS, exact pgvector retrieval, and live database failure behavior were not
run. The verified dense provider is `hashing-v1`, and the verified optional reranker is
`heuristic-v1`; no pinned external embedding model or cross-encoder, license/checksum, or local
model-cache flow was exercised. Selecting those unavailable providers correctly fails readiness,
but that is not equivalent to implementing them.

Docker received static configuration checks only because the daemon was unavailable. Image build,
container health, read-only filesystem behavior, Alembic execution, and the project-pinned Python
3.12 runtime remain unverified; host QA used macOS arm64 with Python 3.14.6. The UI was exercised
through a Node DOM harness rather than a live browser, post-start readiness transition is not yet
covered, the Starlette TestClient deprecation warning remains, and no formal architect, security,
or performance-agent review was performed.

The next highest-value step is to run the existing default stack in Docker on Python 3.12 and
capture container/TCP health and latency evidence without weakening the current disclaimer. If the
repository will claim PostgreSQL/pgvector or neural models as executable features, implement and
integration-test those adapters next; otherwise keep them explicitly deferred. Real catalog data
and marketplace-derived hard negatives are required before revisiting semantic retrieval,
reranking, calibration, or production-accuracy claims.

## 2026-09-01 — Docker/Python 3.12 runtime milestone

### Context, problem, and observable outcome

The preceding handoff had only static Docker Compose validation. The daemon was unavailable during
that QA pass, so the documentation correctly treated image construction, Python 3.12 execution,
container readiness, filesystem restrictions, real port forwarding, and the installed reporting
CLI as unverified. That was the largest remaining gap in the default offline MVP: source-level and
in-process evidence existed, but a user still could not point to a successful build-and-run record
for the shipped container.

This milestone closes that gap for the **default offline runtime**. A no-cache image build ran on
Docker Desktop 29.5.3/aarch64, installed the project on Python 3.12.14, started healthy as non-root
user `pvr` (UID 100) with a read-only root filesystem and writable `/tmp` tmpfs, and exposed only
the loopback-bound API port. From the host, health, UI assets, `matched`, `ambiguous`, and
`no_match` flows were observable; default responses omitted debug data and carried request IDs. A
separate missing-catalog container returned health and resolve 503 without asserting an identity.
The installed `pvr-report` command also generated and validated its JSON, Markdown, and four SVG
artifacts inside the rebuilt read-only image.

### Implementation trace

The runtime work added `scripts/measure_http_latency.py` to give host→container timing a dedicated,
repeatable measurement path instead of reusing the in-process TestClient numbers. Its output,
`reports/runtime-validation/docker-python312-http-latency.json`, freezes the boundary, environment,
warm-up/sample counts, percentile method, summary, raw samples, request payload, and explicit
inclusions/exclusions. Keeping this result separate from `reports/fixture-v1/` prevents the fixture
evaluation report's in-process ASGI latency from being mistaken for a container measurement.

`pyproject.toml` added `httpx2>=2,<3` to runtime dependencies. The reason is operational rather than
test-only: the installed `pvr-report` entry point directly uses FastAPI TestClient when it generates
HTTP samples. The runtime image therefore needs the compatible client library even when development
extras are not installed. The Dockerfile and default Compose configuration did not need a new
product architecture; the milestone exercised their existing non-root, read-only, tmpfs,
loopback-port, and healthcheck settings and captured evidence that those settings work together.

### Technical choices, alternatives, and trade-offs

Host→container latency is measured with a small standard-library HTTP script rather than folding a
live socket test into the fixture evaluator. This keeps the artifact dependency-light and makes the
boundary explicit: host `urllib`, Docker Desktop port forwarding, Uvicorn/FastAPI, resolver work,
and JSON serialization/parsing are included. An in-container TestClient benchmark would be faster
and more deterministic but would skip port forwarding; a full load tool behind TLS and a proxy
would be closer to production but would add infrastructure and concurrency questions outside this
Lite milestone. The selected sequential, concurrency-1 loopback smoke is therefore useful for
runtime verification, not capacity planning.

For reporting dependencies, alternatives included putting `pvr-report` behind a separate extra or
image, rewriting its HTTP measurement to avoid TestClient, or leaving the HTTP client in the dev
extra. Keeping `httpx2` in runtime dependencies makes the already-shipped CLI usable in the default
image with the smallest code change. The trade-off is a larger runtime dependency surface and
weaker rebuild reproducibility because versions are bounded but not locked.

### Decision changes

Before this milestone, Docker/Python 3.12 was documented as unverified and T23 remained partial;
only Compose syntax had passed. After the successful build, health/UI/three-state flow,
missing-catalog failure, filesystem/user checks, and host→container measurement, the default
offline Docker runtime is now an evidenced deliverable and T23 is complete for that Lite boundary.
This does not promote the optional PostgreSQL profile into a working resolver path.

QA also found that the reporter's HTTP client could not be treated as merely a development concern:
`pvr-report` is installed in the runtime image and invokes TestClient directly. The prior dependency
boundary therefore did not guarantee a usable shipped CLI. After moving the compatible client to
runtime requirements, a no-cache rebuild resolved FastAPI 0.141.1, Starlette 1.6.0, httpx2 2.12.0,
and httpcore2 2.12.0; `pvr-report` then produced all six expected artifacts under the read-only,
non-root constraints. The repository still has no lockfile or constraints file, and the dev extra
still lists legacy `httpx`, so this is a runtime-boundary correction rather than complete dependency
reproducibility.

### Verification evidence

The verified image was `product-variant-resolver:lite` with image ID
`sha256:f5df8cba0c0abaae77b1e01be9269cdbef2dd874be5b168da47aed5d365cc739`.
Docker reported version 29.5.3/aarch64; the container reported Python 3.12.14, UID/GID
`100(pvr)/101(pvr)`, `ReadonlyRootfs=true`, and a healthy loopback publication at
`127.0.0.1:8000`. `/app` was not writable and `/tmp` was writable. Container compile passed with
bytecode directed to `/tmp`; mounted API tests passed 8/8 and reporting tests passed 2/2. Earlier
runtime runs also passed 10 unit, 7 integration, 4 evaluation-metric, and 5 fixture tests, while
direct container evaluation retained Recall@25 `1.0`, Top-1 `1.0`, hard-negative accuracy `1.0`,
precision `1.0`, coverage `0.8333`, and false-match rate `0.0`.

The checked-in [Docker latency artifact](../reports/runtime-validation/docker-python312-http-latency.json)
contains 50 finite sequential samples after 10 warm-ups. Sorting those samples and applying the
recorded nearest-rank rule, `ceil(0.95 * 50) - 1`, reproduces p95 **`4.721208 ms`**; median is
`2.7867085 ms` and mean is `3.14272922 ms`. The test used one local macOS arm64 machine,
concurrency 1, loopback, and the offline-memory backend. Container startup, warm-ups, TLS, reverse
proxy, remote network, concurrent load, and PostgreSQL are excluded. This is a runtime smoke result,
not production latency.

The no-cache reporter verification generated exactly one JSON, one Markdown, and four SVG files.
The JSON passed `validate_report_payload`, retained 21 in-process HTTP samples and the exact
21-case synthetic disclaimer, and correctly kept `container.measured=false` because that report's
latency is not the host→Docker artifact. The final [QA review](../specs/product-variant-resolver/review.md)
records R13 as PASS for this limited boundary, R15 as PASS WITH RISK, and R16 as PASS; the full host
suite remains 38/38 green.

### Incomplete work, risks, and next step

The verified boundary is intentionally narrow. PostgreSQL ingestion, FTS, exact pgvector search,
migration-cycle E2E, external embeddings/cross-encoders, TLS, reverse proxy, remote network,
concurrency/load, and post-start dependency failure transitions remain unverified. The runtime
artifact comes from one Docker Desktop arm64 machine and cannot support a production latency or
capacity claim. The UI still lacks a live-browser smoke beyond the Node harness, and no formal
architect, security, or performance-agent review was performed.

Dependency resolution is the next hardening priority. The successful image used compatible bounded
ranges, but no committed lockfile or constraints file ensures the same versions on a future build;
the dev extra's legacy `httpx` also continues to produce a host warning. The next highest-value step
is to freeze or constrain the verified runtime set and reconcile the TestClient dependency across
runtime and development. PostgreSQL/pgvector and external-model adapters should remain explicitly
deferred unless they are implemented and integration-tested before being claimed.

## Required format for future entries

Every future project-log entry must preserve the following traceability structure:

1. **Context, problem, and observable outcome:** explain what triggered the work, what was wrong or
   missing, what was executed, and what a caller or evaluator can observe afterward.
2. **Implementation trace:** name the changed modules or file groups and explain why each group
   changed; do not provide only a list of completed tasks.
3. **Technical choices, alternatives, and trade-offs:** record the selected method, viable
   alternatives considered, and the cost or limitation accepted.
4. **Decision changes:** when a choice is reversed or narrowed, record the before/after decision,
   the exact evidence that triggered it, and any version/configuration impact.
5. **Verification evidence:** cite commands/results already produced by the responsible agent,
   frozen data/report versions, raw-count-derived metrics, runtime/hardware, and measurement scope.
   Never upgrade a static check into runtime evidence or a synthetic result into a production claim.
6. **Incomplete work, risks, and next step:** state deferred adapters, unrun environments/reviews,
   known warnings, and the single highest-value next action.

Entries may use a small table or compact list for navigation, but the main record must remain an
explanatory engineering narrative linked to existing specifications, code, QA evidence, or reports.
